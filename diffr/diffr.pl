usage: diffr -s source -d dest [-p pattern] [-l]

if -p is given, we will only do the diff for filenames which match
this pattern - this matches the full path, so a pattern of 'foo' will
match 'foo.txt', '/home/foo/bar' etc. 

If -l is given, we will simply list files which differ, rather than outputting
the diff.

# add the path to a hash (eg $paths{$thisfile}++), then do the work by walking

#  - if it exists in one but not the other, print the appropriate message
