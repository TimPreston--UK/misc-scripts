=head1 rubbish-reminder

This is likely only of use for Stevenage residents.

Consults the L<stevenage.gov.uk|http://www.stevenage.gov.uk> website, and checks
when the next rubbish/recycling collection is, and sends a notification to my
phone using NotifyMyAndroid L<https://www.notifymyandroid.com/>.

=head2 Configuration

Uses L<Config::Auto> to parse config.

Dump the following into C<~/.rubbish-reminderrc> or any of the other filenames
that Config::Auto would look for:

    nma_key: ...your NMA API key...
    house_num: 1
    postcode: TE57 1NG

(Obviously replacing the fake details with real ones)

It will find out your next collection date and the type, and, if the next
collection date is tomorrow, send a notification via NMA.  It's intended to be
used as a cron job in the evenings.

*NOTE*: The stevenage.gov.uk webform is specific in it's postcode search. You
/must/ include the space in the postcode or it won't find your address.
